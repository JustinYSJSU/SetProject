# SJSU CS146 (Data Structures and Algorithms) Set Project
This is my SetProject from CS146 @ SJSU. I made my own implementation of a LinkedList with the following features. The LinkedList will is only compatiable with String objects

  - Add item to the set
  - Remove item to the set
  - Count number of items to the set
  - Determine if a given item is in the set
  - Searches for a given item
  - Union (items that are in at least one set) between the current set and a given set
  - Intersection (items that are in both sets) between the current set and a given set
  - Create a String representation of the LinkedList 

``You only need to download the setProj.jar file if you want to run the project (see How to Run)``

``If you only want to look at the code, check the projectSet folder instead``

# Goal 
The goal of this project was to implement a LinkedList in Java 

# Technologies 
- Java (Ver 15 or higher)
- JUnit 5

# How to Run 
- Make sure you have Java installed on your computer 
  - Windows: Open the command prompt and type ``java -version``
  - Mac/Linux: Open the terminal and type ``java -version``

- Download the ``setProj.jar`` file
- On your command prompt / ternimal, navigate to the directory where ``setProj.jar`` is located.
- Use the command ``java -jar setProj.jar`` to run the project
