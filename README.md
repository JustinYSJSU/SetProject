# SJSU CS146 (Data Structures and Algorithms) Set Project
This is my SetProject from CS146 @ SJSU. I made my own implementation of a LinkedList

``You only need to download the setProj.jar file if you want to run the project (see How to Run)``
``If you only want to look at the code, check the projectSet folder instead``
